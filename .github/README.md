# Shortcrypt

A easy page to RSA encrypt short text.

## Usage
1. Bob (he wants to receive a message) opens [here](https://utubo.github.io/shortcrypt/), inputs a password to generate the URL of the page for encryption.
2. Alice (she wants to send a message) opens the URL received from Bob, inputs the text and passes the generated URL to Bob.
3. Bob opens the URL received from Alice, and can input the password to decrypt the text.

âš The URLs contains the encrypted data, so better not to have long text.
