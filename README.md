# Shortcrypt

Simple page to RSA encrypt short text.

## Usage
1. Bob (he wants to receive a message) opens [here](https://utubo.github.io/shortcrypt/) input a password, and the URL of the page for encryption is generated.
2. Alice (she wants to send a message) opens the URL received from Bob, inputs the text and passes the generated URL to Bob.
3. Bob opens the URL received from Alice, input the password, and can decrypt the text.

âš The URL will be attached to all the data, so it may be difficult if it is a long text.
